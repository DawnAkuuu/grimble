## Grimble Robot

# What is Grimble?
This robot framework is being used as my own way of learning ROS2 to create my first ROS2 robot.
Eventually this robot will have more details and added features on top of the lesson plan found at this url: https://youtu.be/OWeLUSzxMsw?si=zafxtcA7AtE_bTbw
Thank you for Joshnewans for making this tutorial.

# Robot Hardware
None so far, but here is what the plan to use is:
- Raspberry Pi 4B running Ubuntu 24.04
- Arduino Nano for Motor Control
- Brushed DC motors with encoders
- L298N Motor drivers
